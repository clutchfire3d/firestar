## 1. Meet Firestar
**Forget Gearboxes. Embrace Innovation.**

![Firestar](Pages/Images/Firestar.jpg)

The Firestar was developed by **ClutchFire3D** leveraging **PolarStar Airsoft** technology. Designed from the ground up to extract maximum performance from the **F2™ and Jack™ HPA engines**, this platform eliminates the limitations of adapted AEG bodies.

### What makes Firestar unique:
* ⚙️ **Native HPA (No Gearbox):** Designed specifically for HPA, eliminating the gearbox shell.
* 🎯 **Perfect Alignment:** Alignment is guaranteed by the native design.
* ⚖️ **Ultralight:** Weighing approximately 600g (depending on setup).
* 🛡️ **Robust Geometry:** Optimized for engineering-grade materials (ABS/ASA).
* 🎨 **Total Freedom (DIY):** Compatible with standard M4-style Pistol Grips, Mag Catches, and Stocks.
