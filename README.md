## 1. Meet Firestar
**Forget Gearboxes. Embrace Innovation.**

![Firestar](Pages/Images/Firestar.jpg)

The Firestar was developed by **ClutchFire3D** leveraging **PolarStar Airsoft** technology. Designed from the ground up to extract maximum performance from the **F2™ and Jack™ HPA engines**, this platform eliminates the limitations of adapted AEG bodies.

## 🛠 Recommended Print Settings

To ensure the structural integrity of your Firestar, follow these guidelines:

| Parameter | Recommended Setting |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Material** | **ASA or ABS** (Required for impact resistance and durability) |
| **Wall Line Count** | **4 layers** (Crucial for thread and insert strength) |
| **Infill Density** | **50% or higher** |
| **Support** | Required (Tree supports recommended for cleaner surfaces) |
| **Layer Height** | 0.12mm |

> **⚠️ Warning:** Do not use standard PLA for structural parts, as it may become brittle or warp under heat and mechanical stress.
